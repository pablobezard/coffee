          In my constant search to improve my programming skills, I have decided to take two online courses. 
          One of them, focused on FrontEnd using React, has been provided by Telecom Digitalers Argentina in collaboration with Educación IT. The other course, 
          centered on BackEnd, I am taking on the Alura LATAM platform, sponsored by ONE Oracle.
           Both courses have been a valuable opportunity to polish my programming skills and update myself on the latest technological advances.
           I am committed to my professional growth and strive to stay up-to-date on market trends and changes 🚀 👨‍💻
